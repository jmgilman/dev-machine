# Development Machine

This documentation contains information for building/configuring my personal development machine.

## Overview

All of my development is done remotely through SSH and [VSCode Remote](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).
The machine itself is a custom built desktop ([see specs](./appendix/specs.md)) running inside my office space.
I alternate connecting to it between a Mac M1 Pro laptop and a Mac M2 Studio.

The machine uses [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io) for the operating system.
It is a derivative of [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/) provided by the
[Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) team.
